1) Function calls with parameters seem to prevent do_all detection.
See loop comments for each file.


2) DiscoPop incorrectly identifies reduction variables of the form a[i] where i is the loop counter
I may be incorrect, but I am almost certain that the following is not a reduction:

for i = [1, 10]
	array[i] += 2

yet, Discopop will detect 'array' as a reduction variable with 10 iterations.

reduction_single_loop_0009.c and do_all_single_loop_0006.c are examples of this bug.
'proper_reduction_example.c' is a correctly identified reduction for comparison


3) Geometric decomp do_all detected, but not regular do_all
Removing all function calls from the loop has no effect.


4) Double nested loop do_all detection failure?
Not sure why 0009.c is detected, but 0003.c is not.
